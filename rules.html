<h1>ChessXp</h1>
<h2>Classic Vibe. New Adventures.</h2>
<h3>Claim</h3>
What is described here, is not a chess variant. It's chess. The 10x10 version.
<h3>Summary</h3>
If you like Chess, but not necessarily its restriction to the default rnbqkbnr setup, this respectful innovation attempt might be what you are looking for. It describes a plausible set of rule adjustments that would make chess playable on a 10x10 board, while preserving the minimalist design concept of the original game.
<br><br>
First of all the raw specification for the impatient guys, followed by some notes regarding the concept.<br><br>

<h3>Board</h3>
The board is extended to 100 (10x10) squares. The files are labeled with the letters a-j, the ranks with the numbers 1-10. The lower right square of the board is black.
<h3>Falcon</h3>
One new piece is introduced. The falcon is basically a "big knight" and the logical next twin piece after bishop, knight and rook. While the knight reaches all squares that are part of the second circle around a given square and cannot be reached by rook or bishop, the falcon has the same ability for the third circle. It would control the following fields if placed on the f6 square:

<br><br>
Like the knight, the falcon can "jump over" all other pieces (of either color) to its destination square. 
<br><br>
The piece is complementary to bishop, knight and rook. Means, it covers only squares that are not covered by these pieces:

<br><br>
Each player starts with two falcons.
<h3>Pawns</h3>
The pawns are modified as follows:
<br><br>
They can move up to three steps forward when placed the initial square.
<br><br>
Up to two steps forward when placed on the third, fourth or fifth rank.
<br><br>
One step forward when placed on the sixth rank or higher.
<br><br>
This means a pawn can reach the promotion field within five moves, which is the same number of moves as in classical chess:
<br><br>

<br><br>
En passant capturing is possible each time a pawn passes an enemy pawn by moving more than one square forward in one move. The following example shows possible captures after the white pawn moved three squares forward:
<br><br>

<h3>Castling</h3>
The castling rules are the same as in classical chess. King moves two squares towards the rook, rook jumps over. Thus after 0-0 the king and rook are located on h1 and g1, after 0-0-0 on d1 and e1.

<h3>Initial Setup</h3>
The piece arrangement before move one is as follows:

<h3>Notes</h3>
ChessXp incorporates the following design elements of classical chess:<br><br>
- Two single pieces: The key piece and the strongest piece. The latter has the same move pattern as the key piece but with unlimited range.
<br><br>
- Three (four) pairs of twin pieces that are complementary to each other.
<br><br>
- Pieces with ambiguous routes to their destination squares (knight, falcon) can move directly to these squares regardless if one or all routes are blocked.
<br><br>
- Pawns get slower once they pass a certain rank number.
<br><br>
- All pieces can be developed by moving only the two central pawns.
<br><br>
- No unprotected pawns in the initial position.
<br><br>
Upvaluing the pawns by making them faster seemed necessary to keep the dynamic spirit of the original game that includes fast confrontation and a broad spectrum of possibilities for piece sacrifices.
<br><br>
The falcon might be about as valuable as a rook (my own estimation).
